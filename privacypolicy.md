Privacy Policy for Rephelper Chrome Extension
----------------
# Introduction
Welcome to Rephelper ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our Rephelper Chrome Extension ("Extension"). By using the Extension, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

# Information We Collect
**Website Content**: Our Extension collects content from websites you visit ("Website Content"). This includes, but is not limited to, text, images, links, and other forms of media available on the web pages you access.  
**Uploaded images**: The images you upload in the extension's public table tab.

# How We Use the Information
Providing a Wider Range of Choice: The primary purpose of collecting Website Content is to provide all users with a broader range of choices. The collected data is uploaded to a publicly accessible "table," which can be accessed by anyone who downloads the Extension.
Help find you products: We provide you with an image search that is accessible in the Rephelper extension's public table tab. You can upload images here and find the closest matches stored in our databases. The Uploaded Images will only be stored in memory throughout the duration of the request.

# Sharing of Information
**Public Table**: The Website Content collected by the Extension is uploaded to a publicly accessible table. This means that any user who has downloaded the Extension can view the collected Website Content. By using the Extension, you consent to the sharing of the Website Content you access in this manner.

## Third-Party Services: 
We use third-party services to handle and store the data collected by the Extension:

**Amazon Web Services** (AWS): Our API endpoints are hosted on AWS, which means that Website Content as well as Uploaded Images are transmitted to and processed by AWS servers.  
**MongoDB**: The collected Website Content is stored in a MongoDB database. MongoDB is responsible for the storage and management of this data.  
**Google Cloud**: When you try to image search using our table, the photo you upload will be classified using Google Cloud.  
**Pinecone**: The classified product images are uploaded here(this does not include your Uploaded Images). Your Uploaded Images are used here to find the closest match to your image, but it does not get stored.  

# Data Security
We are committed to protecting your information. However, please be aware that no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.

# Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. Changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
